    A wrapper for Gymnasium environments. The purpose of it is to contain common Gymnasium syntax so that
    it does not have to be copied and pasted in every wrapper. At the same time, it aims to deliver
    flexibility that is required to handle generalised nature of Gymnasium API such as varying state
    representations.

    Args:
        difficulty: The difficulty level of the environment.
        environment_id: Gymnasium environment ID.
        n_frames_stacked: How many most recent states should be stacked together to form a final state
            representation.
        append_step_count: Whether or not append the current step count to each state.
        kwargs: Arguments passed down to ``gymnasium.make``

    Attributes:
        step_count (int): Current step count since the last reset.
        difficulty (int): Difficulty level. Higher values indicate more difficult environments.
        n_frames_stacked (int): How many most recent states should be stacked together to form a final state
            representation. Defaults to 1.
        append_step_count (bool): Whether or not append the current step count to each state.
