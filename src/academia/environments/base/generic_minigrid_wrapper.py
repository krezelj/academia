    """
    A wrapper for MiniGrid environments that makes them scalable.

    Args:
        difficulty: Difficulty level from 0 to 3, where 0 is the easiest
            and 3 is the hardest.
        difficulty_envid_map: A dict that maps numerical difficulty level to gymnasium environment ID.
        n_frames_stacked: How many most recent states should be stacked together to form a final state
            representation.
        kwargs: Arguments passed down to ``gymnasium.make``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the specified difficulty level is invalid.

    Attributes:
        step_count (int): Current step count since the last reset.
        difficulty (int): Difficulty level. Higher values indicate more difficult environments.
        n_frames_stacked (int): How many most recent states should be stacked together to form a final state
            representation. Defaults to 1.
