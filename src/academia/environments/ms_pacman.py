class MsPacman(GenericAtariWrapper):
    """
    An Atari 2600 environment where the agent has to navigate a maze, eat pellets
    and avoid ghosts. The higher the difficulty, the more ghosts to avoid.

    Possible actions:

    | 7   | DOWNRIGHT | Move downright |
    +-----+-----------+----------------+
    | 8   | DOWNLEFT  | Move downleft  |

    Difficulty levels:

    +------------+----------------------------------------------+
    | Difficulty | Description                                  |
    +============+==============================================+
    | 0          | 1 ghost is chasing the player                |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------+
    | 1          | 2 ghosts are chasing the player              |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------+
    | 2          | 3 ghosts are chasing the player              |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------+
    | 3          | 4 ghosts are chasing the player              |
    +------------+----------------------------------------------+

    Args:
        difficulty: Difficulty level from 0 to 3, where 0 is the easiest and 3 is the hardest.
        n_frames_stacked: How many most recent states should be stacked together to form a final state
            representation. Defaults to 1.
        append_step_count: Whether or not append the current step count to each state. Defaults to ``False``.
        flatten_state: Wheter ot not to flatten the state if represented by and RGB or grayscale image.
            If ``obs_type`` is set to ``"ram"`` this parameter does nothing. Defaults to ``False``.
        skip_game_start: Whether or not skip the game start. After every reset the game is an "noop" state
            for 65 frames which can hinder the training process. If true the game skips this stage
            by applying 65 NOOP actions before returning the first observed state. Defaults to ``True``.
        kwargs: Arguments passed down to ``gymnasium.make``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the specified difficulty level is invalid.

    Attributes:
        step_count (int): Current step count since the last reset.
        difficulty (int): Difficulty level. Higher values indicate more difficult environments.
        n_frames_stacked (int): How many most recent states should be stacked together to form a final state
            representation.
        append_step_count (bool): Whether or not append the current step count to each state.
        flatten_state: Wheter ot not to flatten the state if represented by and RGB or grayscale image.
        skip_game_start: Whether or not skip the game start.

    Notes:
        For this environment the keyword argument ``mode`` is not used. This is because Ms Pacman did not
        use the difficulty settings available in Atari but did use mode settings to control the number of
        ghosts on the map. Because of this the ``difficulty`` parameter is mapped to ``mode``.
